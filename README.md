# train_model_BERT_AI

  This is a simple Python code that was created to train the artificial intelligence model known as BERT. It was trained to identify certain defects found in a text. The texts and results are displayed in my native language, Portuguese. This is a simple prototype.

  Before running the main code called `train-model.py`, it will be necessary to install some dependencies. I recommend using virtual environments to isolate the work environment from the main environment. This recommendation is due to some libraries being extremely heavy:

- pip==25.0.1
- numpy==2.2.3
- pandas==2.2.3
- transformers==4.49.0
- datasets==3.3.2
- scikit-learn==1.6.1
- torch==2.6.0
- accelerate==1.4.0
- openpyxl


  Using your preferred terminal, access the project's main folder and run the command `pip intall -r requirements.txt`. After installing the libraries, you will be able to train BERT.

⚠️ **Warning** 

  
  Training an artificial intelligence will consume a lot of machine resources, possibly performing no other tasks during the process, performance is better when running the code through the terminal.
